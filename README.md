# Adidas_Sales_Dashboard
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Adidas's Sales performance from 2020 to 2021. The analysis covers various dimensions, including product categories, retailer performance, state-wise and monthly sales trends.

### Project Overview
This project aims to:
1. Understand the overall sales performance of Adidas.
2. Factors affecting sales of the product.
3. Identify areas for improvement.

### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Adidas US Sales Datasets" file.

### Problem Statement

Adidas, a leading sports brand, seeks to understand its sales performance. The company wants to understand:

1. What is the total sales, average price per unit, operating profit, operating margin and units sold till now.
2. What are the top performing products, retailers and  geographic regions.
3. Identify areas of improvement and opportunities for growth in sales.

### Charts Used
I have used Area chart, Filled Map, Donut Chart, Bar chart to get insights from the data.

### Key insights:

'- Highest Sales states: NewYork and California 
*Lowest Sales state: Nebraska

Top-Selling Product: Men's athletic footwear
Least-Selling Product: Women's athletic footwear 

Top performing retailers: West Gear and Footlocker 
Low performing retailer: Walmart

Region with highest sales: West
Region with lowest sales: Mid-West

### Results:
Adidas’s Sales performance from 2020 to 2021, reveals significant growth in total sales increasing from $182M to $718M. The top selling products that drives sales growth are Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s apparel. Adidas’s partnerships with Foot Locker and West Gear proved to be highly effective, which makes them top performers. In terms of regional sales trends, West drives the most sales. NewYork and California are the highest sales generating states but NewYork’s sales drop is a matter of concern.

### Recommendations

The company should focus on optimizing sales of women’s athletic footwear and expanding Adidas’s presence in underperforming states like Nebraska. Adidas should focus on NewYork’s market as it has much potential to contribute in total sales. It should implement its marketing strategies in peak sales months like July and August to get maximum profit.
